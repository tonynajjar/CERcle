# CERcle
CERN Summer Student Webfest winning project


This project was conceived in 2 days only and is the winner of CERN’s annual Webfest!

CERcle is an interactive and educational LED-based game that puts you in control of CERN’s LHC!

It consists of a mosaic of arcs and circles of LEDs as to represent CERN’s most renowned LHC, SPS and PS. The particle light show is controlled using a gyroscope-based wireless handle.
Anyone can gradually accelerate the particles from one accelerator to the other until the big collision and a light-spectacle!
